# Download Link Clicked

Download link clicks will be automatically detected by comparing the href of the link clicked to a predefined list of file extensions. This spec is for manually firing download links if necessary, such as for a button that asynchronously generates the file that will be downloaded using an onClick event.

## Data Attributes HTML Code

```html
  <a href="<linkDestination>" 
    data-layer-event-prefix="Download Link"
    data-layer-action="click"
    data-layer-category="<category>"
    data-layer-subcategory="<subcategory?>"
    data-layer-subcategory2="<subcategory2?>"
    data-layer-text="<text?>"

    data-layer-file-name="<fileName>" 
    data-layer-report-name="<reportName>"
    data-layer-report-type="<fileType>"
  >
```
Items with a ? are optional

## Generated Javascript Code

```js
window.appEventData = window.appEventData || [];
appEventData.push({
  "event": "Download Link Clicked",
  "linkInfo": {
    "category": "<category?>",
    "subcategory": "<subcategory?>",
    "subcategory2": "<subcategory2?>",
    "fileName": "<fileName>",
    "regions": "<regions?>",
    "reportName": "<reportName>"
    "reportType": "<fileType>",
    "text": "<text>",
  }
});
```
Items with a ? may not be generated depending on what attributes are present and the ancestry of the clicked item.
