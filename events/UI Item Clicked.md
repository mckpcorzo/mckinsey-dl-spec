# UI Item Clicked

These HTML attributes should be added to items that do not qualify as CTAs, but that still need to be tracked. Examples include expanding a UI accordion, clicking on a tab, or clicking on an interactive component.

## Data Attributes HTML Code

```html
  <a href="<linkDestination>"
    data-layer-event-prefix="UI Item"
    data-layer-action="click"
    data-layer-category="<category>"
    data-layer-subcategory="<subcategory?>"
    data-layer-subcategory2="<subcategory2?>"
    data-layer-text="<text?>"
  >
```

Items with a ? are optional

## Generated Javascript Code

```js
window.appEventData = window.appEventData || [];
appEventData.push({
  "event": "UI Item Clicked",
  "linkInfo": {
    "category": "<category>",
    "subcategory": "<subcategory>"
    "regions": "<regions?>",
    "text": "<text>",
  }
});
```

Items with a ? may not be generated depending on what attributes are present and the ancestry of the clicked item.
